%h2 Help for EOPAS: Frequently asked questions

%h3 How to cite a phrase?

#paragraph
  As a video or audio element plays back and there are annotation phrases, the URL of the browser changes. The URL adapts to the time code of the phrase. You can pause the video or audio element and cut and paste the URL for citation purposes.
  
#paragraph
  Alternatively, you can also right click on the little black "play" button of a phrase and copy the link address.

%h3 Where are the XML schemas of the formats?

%ul
  %li
    = link_to "EOPAS XML schema", "SCHEMAS/eopas.xsd"
  %li
    = link_to "Toolbox XML schema", "SCHEMAS/toolbox.xsd"
  %li
    = link_to "Transcriber XML schema", "SCHEMAS/transcriber.xsd"
  %li
    = link_to "ELAN XML schema", "SCHEMAS/elan.xsd"

%h3 Where are the XSL Transforms to convert between formats?

%ul
  %li
    = link_to "Toolbox to EOPAS", "XSLT/toolbox2eopas.xsl"
  %li
    = link_to "Toolbox cleaning", "XSLT/fixToolbox.xsl"
  %li
    = link_to "Transcriber to EOPAS", "XSLT/transcriber2eopas.xsl"
  %li
    = link_to "ELAN to EOPAS", "XSLT/elan2eopas.xsl"

%h3 What format does a Toolbox input file have to be for import?

#paragraph
  Some Toolbox files use camel-case on element and attribute names.
  Others come with a namespace of "tb:" on all the elements.
  These differences will be removed using a clean-up script called fixToolbox.xsl.

#paragraph
  The following mapping of Toolbox elements to EOPAS is undertaken:

%ul
  %li
    %pre
      itmgroup          -> tier@linguistic_type['transcription']
  %li
    %pre
      idgroup           ->   phrase
  %li
    %pre
      concat txgroup/tx ->     text
  %li
    %pre
      txgroup           ->     wordlist
  %li
    %pre
      tx                ->       word/text
  %li
    %pre
      mr                ->         morphemelist/morpheme/text@kind['morpheme']
  %li
    %pre
      mg                ->         morphemelist/morpheme/text@kind['gloss']
  %li
    %pre
      fg                -> tier@linguistic_type['translation']/phrase/text


%h3 What format does a Transcriber input file have to be for import?

#paragraph

  In EOPAS we don't know about different speakers, so speaker turns are removed.
  The EOPAS XML file format moves the speaker information on the phrase.
  Topic information and the sections are removed.

#paragraph
  The following mapping of Transcriber elements to EOPAS is undertaken:

%ul
  %li
    %pre
      Episode            -> tier@linguistic_type['transcription']
  %li
    %pre
      Sync               ->   phrase with Turn@speaker
  %li
    %pre
      Sync.content()     ->     text
  %li
    %pre
      Comment@desc       ->     text with "[" "]"
  %li
    %pre
      Event@desc+@extent ->     text with "[" "]"


%h3 What format does an Elan input file have to be for import?

#paragraph

  Elan allows a vast combination of tier types and the choice of tier names is up to the author.
  The EOPAS file format only supports a limited structure, so only three different types of Elan files are being supported.

#paragraph
  Option 1: The following mapping of Elan elements with default-lt tiers is undertaken:
%ul
  %li
    %pre
      tier=default-lt    -> tier@linguistic_type['transcription']/phrase/text

#paragraph
  Option 2: The following mapping of Elan elements with utterance tiers is undertaken:
%ul
  %li
    %pre
      tier=utterance     -> tier@linguistic_type['transcription']/phrase/text
  %li
    %pre
      tier=words         ->   phrase/wordlist/word/text

#paragraph
  Option 3: The following mapping of Elan elements with ref tiers is undertaken:
%ul
  %li
    %pre
      tier=ref           -> tier@linguistic_type['transcription']/phrase/text
  %li
    %pre
      tier=tx            ->   wordlist/word/text
  %li
    %pre
      tier=mr            ->        morphemelist/morpheme/text@kind['morpheme']
  %li
    %pre
      tier=mg            ->        morphemelist/morpheme/text@kind['gloss']
  %li
    %pre
      tier=fg            -> tier@linguistic_type['translation']/phrase/text
