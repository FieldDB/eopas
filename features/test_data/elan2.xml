        <ANNOTATION_VALUE>From my perspective, I’m just talking about the gurrutu (kinship) system, name system—how we finalise the names of people; how they were doing it for 40,000 years or more than that—and this is the structure that actually named the name of a person, particular names, and our structure, the lining up a giving a name, it was not adopted names. The names were given to the land and the places and the reŋgitj (nations) of Dhuwa and Yirritja moiety through the creation of the land.

        <ANNOTATION_VALUE>[Translation from Yolŋu-Matha] Good, I am now going to clarify some types of name to be identified in accordance with our naming system. We are now doing something that our elders before us did not have included in English texts. Our elders only spoke about things like the marks on a letter stick or on skin. This is what we are doing now because we still know all about the pattern work applied to letter sticks. Their leftover scrapings represent our authority to take on this knowledge and share it with others. Whether it be public, sheltered or restricted or whether pertain to someone who has passed away, they had that authority. From the beginning, their authority was in the pattern work of those letter sticks and other peoples immediately recognised their patterns.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

We are now going to mend holes in the written record of our knowledge. None stopped to understand properly our world view. Elders of each group at Galiwin’ku and Miliŋinbi were in village councils and were greatly preoccupied with local governance under the Commonwealth but, from the perspective of our own law, we should now be recognised by all institutions and libraries because what we propose is good for all. The hereditary owners of our law, paintings, language and dances already held in collections internationally play only small roles in their use.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

You’ve got to turn in the hospital. Get a birth certificate or whatever. Yo (Yes), those kinds of thing. Now, because of that and I’m in this area now: this generation. 40 years ago I wasn’t going to do this or, you know, 50 years ago because I sort of recognised myself to the public to the other constitution.

        <ANNOTATION_VALUE>Okay then, so I was in a hospital. I got to register my name and that register is the same like for people coming as a migrant in the 1950s. They came over to Australia and we said, ‘you have to be registering yourself’, and start registering people and start registering what speaking language you are. You will have your culture but your speaking language will be common language for most Australians which means that was English. Same goes. Then my given name was ‘Joe’. So my parents gave me a name, Djäwa and Eva Maraŋiny, my mother—I’m Gupapuyŋu and my mother is Djambarrpuyŋu—they gave me a name, ‘Joe’: Balanda (Anglo) Name, Given Name. It’s a foreign name.

        <ANNOTATION_VALUE>(2) Then they, secondly, gave me a Yolŋu Name. My Yolŋu Name was ‘Neparrŋa’. ‘Neparrŋa’ means in Yolŋu philosophy, the Yolŋu academic system, Yirritja and Dhuwa … Our names are given as very unique names which represent something: a nature. They represent the land. They represent the species. Accordingly, those are my whole family too. They represent us. We represent them. This is, for instance, they gave me the name ‘Neparrŋa’. It’s a Hammerhead Shark. Everybody knows that Hammerhead Shark. ‘Garraŋunuŋ’ is the other word. ‘Garraŋunuŋ’ is another one. Its name’s ‘Neparrŋa’. ‘Neparrŋa’ is his name, ‘Garraŋunuŋ’.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

        <ANNOTATION_VALUE>(3) The Surname … Later in the 1970s they created, ‘We will have a Surname’ like John Douglas Amos so on. You have these long names but where do the surnames fit in? That is a bit of a … I think surnames will go later on. I’ll show you surnames later on. Anyway, the surnames which I collected, whether it’s ‘Gumbula’ or ‘Gaykamaŋu’, they’re still on one line lining up. This is still the bush ‘Honey’. This is still the bush ‘Honey’ and my surname represents the ‘Honey’ which is ‘Gumbula’.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

        <ANNOTATION_VALUE>(4) Next, the Elders of the clan … The father actually asks the Elders of the clan, ‘What will be his other name?’ The other name is compared to the landlords or the land owner who holds the whole of the land—a big block of acres of land which the Gupapuyŋu have and those land have—and those lands have Bundurr Names and that represents, when someone’s passed away, you are already automatically fitted into that category. Someone has it because you’re a Bundurr, you’re a ‘Gaykamaŋu’, you’re a ‘Gumbula’ but the land holds another Bundurr which they will give me under the land’s surname. It’s all held by the Gupapuyŋu people but we are also separate sorts of people whose landlords are named after the Dhumurruŋu Name.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

It’s a lake and my surname as a landlord is not Djiliwirri because all of our people are from Djiliwirri, all of us, and some of the few people’s, my father’s, land is Lake Evella where the lake is, Gapuwiyak So his Dhumurruŋu Name is ‘Dhäwirrŋu’ and could be mine could be the same Dhumurruŋu Name instead of ‘Dhäwirrŋu’ but I have to go and pick another word for that. There are hundreds of meanings in the name of that lake itself so I’ll call myself, my Dhumurruŋu Surname is, ‘Guduwulumirri’.</ANNOTATION_VALUE>

You could see or hear, or get any sort of documentation that people have been getting hasn’t gone through this structure—a birth certificate for Yolŋu, yo (yes)—and, you know, you go down … I can go and get myself a passport with all of this written and this means the government will see and this means the agency will see.
