About
-----

EOPAS is a system to take outputs of normal linguistic analytical processes of
audio and video files and present them online as interlinear text. It provides
an easy to use interface for the presentation and interaction of audio or video
recordings together with their native language transcripts, marked-up as IGT,
and translations into modern languages (mostly English).  Input text can come
from a multitude of linguistic tools, such as ELAN, Transcriber, or IGT
(inter-linear glossed text) from Toolbox.
