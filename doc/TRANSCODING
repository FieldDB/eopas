Transcoding and Validating Transcriptions by hand
=================================================

If you need to deal with just the the xsl transcriptions, you can use the following two command-line programs:

 rails runner bin/validate.rb features/test_data/toolbox2.xml Toolbox
 
 rails runner bin/transcode.rb features/test_data/toolbox2.xml Toolbox

The first one validates, the second one transcodes.
